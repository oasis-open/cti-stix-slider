cti-stix-slider
===============

NOTE: This is an `OASIS TC Open
Repository <https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-
repositories/>`_.
See the `Governance`_ section for more information.

The stix-slider is a software tool for 'sliding' STIX 2.x JSON to STIX
1.x XML. Due to the differences between STIX 1.x and STIX 2.x, this
conversion is best-effort only. During the conversion, stix-slider
provides information on the assumptions it needs to make to produce
valid STIX
1.x XML, and what information was not able to be converted.

The stix-slider is a work-in-progress. It should be used to explore
how STIX 2.x content could potentially be represented in STIX 1.x.
Using the current version of the slider will provide insight to issues
that might need to be mitigated to convert your STIX 2.x content for
use in application that accept only STIX 1.x content.

**It should not be used in a production environment, and should not be
considered final.**

Please enter any comments on how to improve it into the issue tracker.

For more information, see `the
documentation <https://cti-stix-slider.readthedocs.io/>`__ on
ReadTheDocs.



Requirements
------------

- Python 3.8+
- `python-stix <https://stix.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and its dependencies

  .. note::

      Make sure to use either the latest version of python-stix
      1.1.1.x or
      1.2.0.x, depending on whether you want to support STIX 1.1.1 or
      STIX 1.2.

-  `python-stix2 <https://pypi.org/project/python-stix2>`_ >= 3.0.0
-  `stixmarx <https://pypi.org/project/stixmarx>`_ >= 1.0.8
-  `stix-validator <https://pypi.org/project/stix-validator>`_ >= 3.0.0

Installation
------------

Install with pip::

    $ pip install stix2-slider

This will install all necessary dependencies, including the latest
version of python-stix.

If you need to support older STIX 1.1.1 content, install python-stix
1.1.1.x
first::

    $ pip install 'stix<1.2'
    $ pip install stix2-slider

You can also install the stix-slider from GitHub to get the latest
(unstable) version::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix-slider.git

Usage
-----

It is recommended that you ensure that the input STIX 2.x file is
valid before submitting it to the slider.
Use the `stix2-validator <https://pypi.org/project//stix2-validator>`_.

As A Script
~~~~~~~~~~~

The slider comes with a bundled script which you can use to convert
STIX 2.x content to STIX 1.x content::

        usage: stix2_slider [-h] [--no-squirrel-gaps] [--validator-args VALIDATOR_ARGS]
                            [-e ENABLE] [-d DISABLE] [-s]
                            [--message-log-directory MESSAGE_LOG_DIRECTORY]
                            [--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR,CRITICAL}]
                            [--use-namespace USE_NAMESPACE]
                            file

        stix2-slider v4.0.1

        The stix2-slider is a work-in-progress. It should be used to explore how
        existing STIX 2.x would potentially be represented in STIX 1.x. Using the
        current version of the stix2-slider will provide insight to issues that might need
        to be mitigated so you can use an application that supports only STIX 1.x content.

        positional arguments:   The input STIX 2.x document to be 'slid' to STIX 1.x..

        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit

          --no-squirrel-gaps    Do not include STIX 2.x content that cannot be
                                represented directly in STIX 1.x using the description
                                property.

          --validator-args VALIDATOR_ARGS
                                Arguments to pass to stix-validator. Example:
                                stix2_slider <file> --validator-args="--best-
                                practices"

          -e ENABLE, --enable ENABLE
                                A comma-separated list of the stix2-slider messages to
                                enable. If the --disable option is not used, no other
                                messages will be shown. Example: stix2_slider <file>
                                --enable 250

          -d DISABLE, --disable DISABLE
                                A comma-separated list of the stix2-slider messages to
                                disable. Example: stix2_slider <file> --disable
                                212,220

          -s, --silent          If this flag is set. All stix2-slider messages will be
                                disabled.

          --message-log-directory MESSAGE_LOG_DIRECTORY
                                If this flag is set, all stix2-slider messages will be
                                saved to file. The name of the file will be the input
                                file with extension .log in the specified directory.
                                Note, make sure the directory already exists. Example:
                                stix2_slider <file> --message-log-directory "../logs"

          --log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR,CRITICAL}
                                The logging output level.

          --use-namespace USE_NAMESPACE
                                Override the 'example' namespace with the provided one.
                                The format is the prefix, namespace uri and optionally
                                the schema location separated by a space. Example:
                                stix2_slider <file> --use-namespace="example
                                http://example.com"

        Refer to slider_log_messages.rst for all stix2-slider messages. Use the associated code number
        to --enable or --disable a message. By default, the stix2-slider displays all
        messages. Note: disabling the message does not disable the functionality.

As A Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also use this library to integrate STIX 'sliding' into your
own
tools. You can slide a STIX 2.x file::

      from stix2slider import slide_file
      from stix2slider.options import initialize_options

      initialize_options()
      results = slide_file("stix_file.json")
      print(results)

Additionally, a similar method exists to accept a string as an
argument::

      from stix2slider import slide_string
      from stix2slider.options import initialize_options

      initialize_options()
      results = slide_string("...")
      print(results)

To set options, use set_option_value, found in options.py.
